    <string name="caption">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace born 10 December 1815, died 27 November 
        1852, born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English 
        mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbages early mechanical 
        general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is 
        recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, 
        she is often described as the worlds first computer programmer.  Lovelace was the only 
        legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella 
        Byron. The mother of Ada Lovelace promoted her interest in mathematics and logic.  Ada described her 
        approach as poetical science and herself as an Analyst (and Metaphysician). As a young adult, 
        her mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship and friendship with fellow 
        British mathematician Charles Babbage, and in particular Babbages work on the Analytical 
        Engine. Between 1842 and 1843, she translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi 
        Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes of her own, 
        simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer 
        program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.  The Lovelace notes are 
        important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision on the capability of 
        computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage 
        himself, focused only on those capabilities. Ada Lovelace had a mind-set of poetical science 
        that led her to ask basic questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) 
        examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</string>

    <string name="caption_land">Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an 
        American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field, she 
        was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first 
        compiler for a computer programming language.  She conceptualized the idea of 
        machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the 
        first modern programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term debugging for 
        fixing computer glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). Owing to the 
        breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as Amazing 
        Grace. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the Cray XE6 
        Hopper supercomputer at NERSC.</string>
